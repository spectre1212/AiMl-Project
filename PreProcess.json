  "Text": "There is a really difficult initial phase to learn AI. You need to stick to it for good few weeks. After that, it starts to make sense.\nAfter that initial phase, coders can swim through it like a torpedo. If you have studied maths in class 11-12th, that‚Äôs it. Remember, you don‚Äôt write maths, you write code. Maths will help you to understand concepts, that‚Äôs it. Basics of dot product, cosine (similarity), etc.\n\nIf online bootcamp can transition non-tech to AI jobs in 6-8 months, imagine the speed of coders. Coding is and will always remain your most powerful weapon. Master it first and then jump into any pool: web, mobile, web3, AI, or something else.\n\nThere is even a shortcut road if you are an experienced dev. That‚Äôs to understand vector embedding and play with langchain. You can build so much with just these two.\n\nNow I can say that I am getting a little comfortable in the AI space; past experience is really helping me."
